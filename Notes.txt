for every problem involving math in the solution I barely understand what any of the math concepts are this is because most of those involved are new to me. While I am not good at math, I am fairly capable of implementing an algorithm if the math for it is given. 
    This course has been an excellent opportunity for me to learn more and gain practice with not only programming but also math.
    
Things I've learned so far:
    What math Functions are
    Bisection Search(which honestly seems very similar to Binary Search)
    That I need so socialized more both online and offline especially with people smarter then I am
